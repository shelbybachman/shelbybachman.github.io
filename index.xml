      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m a Research Scientist at ŌURA, where I conduct research to shape tools that support health, wellness, and longevity. Prior to joining ŌURA, I worked at VivoSense, where I used data from wearable devices to develop digital measures for clinical trials. I completed my PhD in the Emotion &amp;amp; Cognition Lab at the University of Southern California, where I studied brain, behavioral, and physiological outcomes associated with successful aging. You can find a list of my publications here.</description>
