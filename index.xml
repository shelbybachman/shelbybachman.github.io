      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m a Research Scientist at VivoSense, where I use data from wearable devices to develop digital measures that can be deployed in clinical trials. Prior to working at VivoSense, I completed my PhD in the Emotion &amp;amp; Cognition Lab at the University of Southern California, where I studied how stress and physiological arousal affect what we remember and pay attention to, and how these processes change across the lifespan. Prior to that, I studied neuroscience at Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin and the University of Southern California.</description>

      <description>Academic projects Isometric handgrip exercise speeds working memory responses in younger and older adults.
Decades of animal and pharmacological research have linked the brain&amp;rsquo;s noradrenergic system to working memory, but there has been relatively little non-pharmacological work in humans examining how isolated fluctuations in noradrenegic activity to working memory performance. We examined how performing isometric handgrip exercise, a manipulation known to influence noradrenergic activity, affected working memory performance. Our results indicated that performing handgrip decreased reaction times on a subsequent working memory task in both younger and older adults.</description>
